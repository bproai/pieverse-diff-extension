# PieVerse Diff Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension to help you view and merge code differences inspired by Roo Code/Roo Cline. This extension connects via WebSocket to your Tauri app to receive suggested code updates, then displays a side-by-side diff using VS Code's built-in diff viewer.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates:**  
  Receives suggested code changes from your Tauri app using WebSocket.
  
- **Side-by-Side Diff View:**  
  Opens a diff view between your current file and the suggested update.
  
- **Workspace-Aware Notifications:**  
  Only shows notifications for files that exist in your current workspace.

- **Configurable Diff Behavior:**  
  Choose whether diffs open automatically or wait for you to review them.

- **Action Buttons:**  
  Easily accept, reject, or selectively apply changes with a single click.

- **Multiple Workspace Support:**  
  Works correctly with multiple VS Code windows open for different projects.

## Settings

- **WebSocket URL:**  
  Configure the WebSocket URL to connect to your Tauri app (default: `ws://localhost:3001`).

- **Create Backup Files:**  
  Option to create backup files before applying changes (useful if you don't use Git).

- **Auto-Open Diff View:**  
  Control whether diff views open automatically when receiving suggestions (default: enabled).

## Commands

- `pieverse-diff.connect`: Connect to the PieVerse server
- `pieverse-diff.showDiff`: Show the diff view for a file
- `pieverse-diff.acceptChanges`: Accept all suggested changes
- `pieverse-diff.rejectChanges`: Reject suggested changes
